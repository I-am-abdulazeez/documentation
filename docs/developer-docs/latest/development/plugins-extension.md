# Plugins extension

:::warning
New versions of Strapi are released with [migration guides](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.md), but these guides might not cover unexpected breaking changes in your plugin extensions. Consider forking a plugin if extensive customizations are required.
:::

Strapi plugins can be installed as npm packages in your `node_modules` folder. This allows for easy updates and respects best practices.

Plugin customizations code sit in the `./extensions` folder. Some plugins automatically create files there so you can then modify them. You can also create files manually to add some custom configuration.
<!-- TODO: add link to new project structure when updated -->

:::details Example of extensions folder structure:

```bash
/extensions
  /some-plugin-to-extend
    strapi-admin.js
    strapi-server.js
    /content-types
      /some-content-type-to-extend
        model.json
      /another-content-type-to-extend
        model.json
  /another-plugin-to-extend
    strapi-admin.js
```

Plugins can be extended in 2 ways:

- extending the plugin Content-Types
- extending the plugin interface (e.g. to add controllers, services, policies, middlewares and more)


## Extending a plugin's Content-Types

To overwrite a plugin's [Content-Types](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.md#models):

1. _(optional)_ If it does already exists, create the `./extensions` folder at the root the app.
2. Create a subfolder with the same name as the plugin to be extended.
3. Create a `content-types` subfolder.
4. Inside the `content-types` subfolder, create another subfolder with the same name as the Content-Type to overwrite.
5. Inside this `content-types/name-of-content-type` subfolder, define the new schema for the Content-Type in a `schema.json` file (see [`schema`](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/models.md#model-schema) documentation).

## Extending a plugin's interface

A plugin's interface can be extended using Strapi's programmatic APIs such as the [Server API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/server.md) and the [Admin Panel API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.md).

To extend a plugin's interface:

1. _(optional)_ If it does already exists, create the `./extensions` folder at the root the app.
2. Create a subfolder with the same name as the plugin to be extended.
3. Depending on what needs to be extended:
    * create a `strapi-server.js` file to extend a plugin's back end using the [Server API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/server.md)
    * or create a  `strapi-admin.js` file to extend the admin panel with the [Admin Panel API](/Users/piwi/code/documentation/docs/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-paenl.md).
4. Within this file, define and export a function.  The function receives the `plugin` interface as an argument so it can be extended.

::: details Example of backend extension

```js
// path: ./extensions/some-plugin-to-extend/strapi-server.js

module.exports = (plugin, strapi) => {
  pluginConfig.controllers.controllerA.find = (ctx) => {};

  pluginConfig.policies[newPolicy] = (ctx) => {};

  pluginConfig.routes.push({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/route-path',
    handler: 'controller.action',
  });
};
```

## Content-Types loading order

A plugin's Content-Types can be extended in 2 ways, using the programmatic interface within `.strapi-server.js` and by overriding the Content-Types schemas.

The final schema of the Content-Types depends on the following loading order:

1. the Content-Types of the original plugin,
2. the Content-Types overriden by the declarations in the [schema](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/models.md#model-schema) defined in `./extensions/plugin-name/content-types/content-type-name/schema.json`
3. the Content-Types declarations in the [`content-types` key exported from `.strapi-server.js`](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/server.html#content-types)
